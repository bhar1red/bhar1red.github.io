<blockquote>
<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;<br>
   <br>
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  <br>
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  <br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat those two impostors just the same;  <br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools;<br>
    <br>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,  <br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ <br>
   <br>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  <br>
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,  <br>
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p></blockquote>

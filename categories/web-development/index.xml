      <description>[comment]: # (Project should contain Summary, Description, Repo and Live urls, Screenshot or demo video and Tutorials( if any.))
The American Institute of Architects is a professional organization for architects in the United States. I feel privileged to work for this organization. As a web developer there, from 2015-2016, we built this website, using Drupal 8 and EmberJS.
This project is one of early adopters of &amp;lsquo;Progressive Decoupled&amp;rsquo; architecture. We made use Drupal8&amp;rsquo;s REST API and Ember Datastore and Ember fastboot to achieve this.</description>

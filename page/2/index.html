          <h2> If By Rudyard Kipling </h2>
        </a>
        
        
        
        <p> <p>I read this as a teen and never felt so inspired. I still keep reading to keep myself inspired.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkjdeuwlv/image/upload/c_scale,w_500,f_auto/v1580319655/bargavkondapu.com/posts/if-rudyard-kipling.jpg" alt="If by Rudyard Kipling"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;<br>
   <br>
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  <br>
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  <br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat those two impostors just the same;  <br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools;<br>
    <br>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,  <br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ <br>
   <br>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  <br>
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,  <br>
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p></blockquote>

<p>Interaction with 3 kids that my wife was babysitting. They were watching some random game reviewer’s video, where he was asking different ‘what would you choose?’ questions and showing polls of what other people chose afterwards.</p>
<p>One of the question is “Would you be incredibly stupid, but lucky or be incredibly genius, but unlucky?”</p>
<p>Kid 1: What question is that, of course I would choose genius.</p>
<p>Kid 2: Yeah me too. [After a pause] but being lucky is lucky. I would prefer to be lucky.</p>
<p>Kid 1: No. But that makes you stupid. No body wants to be stupid. I would choose genius and unlucky</p>
<p>Kid 2: What would you do being genius it is of no use to you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Me: Kids, you are both right, but you are missing other factors such as hard work and planning. <strong>It doesn’t matter whether you are genius or lucky, unless you put in effort you can’t succeed.</strong></p>
<p>Kid 3 [came running to me]: His time of choosing video is over. It’s my turn , can I choose the next video.</p>
<p>They soon moved on to watching next video, but I am still stuck with that question.</p>

          <h2> Problem With Fake News in Digital Marketing </h2>
        </a>
        
        
        
        <p> <p>I was scrolling through my news feed, and shocked at what I found.</p>
<p>First, It was a story about a news paper vendor that helped Bill Gates when he doesn&rsquo;t have money.  - Fake</p>
<p>Next, It was a story about an interaction between JRD Tata and Amitabh - Fake.</p>
<p>Then, another couple of posts describing interactions where either candidates outsmarted interviewers or employees outsmarted their bosses. - Fake <br/>
Followed by a question of &ldquo;what do you think?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Follow for more such stories&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Problem is, such posts gets you views, likes, and LinkedIn connections but can never form a real connection.  At some point, people differentiate between genuine and fake ones. When that happens, you might loose your authenticity and trust.</p>
<p>Digital Marketing is not just about quick views and likes, its about being authentic, gaining trust and earning loyal customers.</p>

<p>A concept shoot, inspired from the conflict of decisions we face every single day.</p>
<p><em>Your life is not defined by one big decision. It is defined by small decisions you make over and over again.</em></p>

        <p> <p>I was talking to a 5 yr old girl, X and asked her to tell a story, while she is sketching</p>
<p>X - Drew 3 figures on a paper, started speaking, pointing to them :</p>
<p>This is a princess, and this is her mean step mom. She used to trouble princess. This is prince. They both killed their mean step mom and lived happily.</p>
<p>Me : Oh that’s good. Can you tell another one.</p>
<p>X - Again drew 3 more figures : This is the princess, and this is an ugly monster.
Monster attacked princess. Then prince came and saved her, and killed the monster.</p>
<p>Me : Well, another one.</p>
<p>X - Drew 3 more figures : This is the princess, you see her big gown. This is the bad guy.
Prince came and fights the bad guy and saved the princess.</p>
<p>As cute as she said it, it is equally frightening. This is not how children should be influenced.</p>
<p><em>To all young girls - There will be no prince charming, coming to your rescue. You have to fight your own battles.</em></p>

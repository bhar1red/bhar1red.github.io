<p>X: (After a minute of thinking) Have you ever asked or being asked by others, questions like what do you do? what are you doing? what next? what for? &hellip;</p>

<p>Me: Yes. Almost all the time&hellip;</p>

         <p> <p>Met this amazing person, Mr. X at a conference, who turned his side hustle into his career recently.</p>

<p>Me: Any tips on transitioning a hobby into business?</p>

<p>X: Yes. But first of all, know the difference between a hobby and side project.</p>

<p>Me: ??</p>

<p>X: Hobby is something you are passionate about and do it for yourself. Side project is something you are passionate about, but do it for community, people, the world.
Side projects can be made into business, because you are contributing where as hobby is just meant to be a hobby.</p>

<p>Me: Still confusing, could you give an example.</p>

<p>X: Yes. If you collect currency, because you want to have huge collection of them, it&rsquo;s an hobby. If you are passionate about educating people about various currencies, and started collecting them so you can demonstrate, that would be a side project which could be turned into a career.</p>

         <p> 

<p>There have been a lot of articles on leadership/ entrepreneurial skills these days. But you know, these qualities have been mentioned hundreds of years ago. In fact, the hidden goal of âBhagavatamâ from Hindu mythology (Ten forms of Vishnu) might be to explain these qualities, in a filmy style, though. I would like to explain what each avatar is trying to portray and how they are relevant in today&rsquo;s world.</p>

<h2 id="1-matshya-vision-dream">1. Matshya: [Vision, Dream]</h2>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dkjdeuwlv/image/upload/c_crop,g_south,h_675,w_1200,f_auto/v1522513666/bargavkondapu.com/posts/dashavatar_matsya.jpg" alt="Depiction of Matshya Avatar" /></p>

<p>[A Fish that predicted huge storm coming through, warned the king to save life chain, guided their ship to a safe place]</p>

<p>Successful leaders are visionaries. They are able to foresee the problems and opportunities. They have a vision and guide people towards that vision. In this process, they might even change the world, forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have a dream&hellip;&rdquo;-Martin Luther King Jr</p>

<p>We all witnessed how his vision, redefined history.</p>

<h2 id="2-kurma-patience-hope">2. Kurma: [Patience, Hope]</h2>

<p>[Turtle that gave hope to tired and âabout to give awayâ gods and demons to continue churning of ocean, till they get what they started it for]</p>

<p>One of the most important qualities for upcoming entrepreneurs â Patience. When working towards a great goal, the team has to go through a lot of difficulties. They face criticism, Results donât turn as expected â¦ The team can easily get discouraged and might give up. Itâs leaders responsibility to inspire them, have patience, make the team believe in their dream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more timeâ â Thomas A. Edison</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Edison wouldnât have tried 10000 times, we might still read under candle lights</p>

<h2 id="3-varaha-courage">3. Varaha: [Courage]</h2>

<p>[A Wandering pig, that found earth hidden inside water. In spite of knowing a great risk ahead, it went alone and saved it]</p>

<p>A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make through tough situations. Everyone has fear of obstacles, but in order to successfully accomplish a goal, a leader must have to overcome those fears, risk everything and go ahead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>âDo not come up, I will handle them,â â Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, Martyr of 26 / 11 attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These were Last words before saving hostages and his death</p>

<h2 id="4-narasimha-responsibility">4. Narasimha: [Responsibility]</h2>

<p>[Lion-Headed human, that killed a Demon King Hiranyakashyap, who threatens to kill his own son for being a worshiper of Vishnu ]</p>

<p>A true entrepreneur is responsible for protecting his team during worse scenarios. He/she must give confidence to their team that theyâll stand by through good and bad times. They must take responsibility and do all they can to protect their team members.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>âPehle ye batao Sachin ki naam ki spelling galat kisne likhi? (First answer this: who wrote Sachinâs spelling wrong?)â â M.S. Dhoni</p>
</blockquote>

<p>âAny one can make things hard and complex. It takes a touch of genius to make it simpleâ â Albert Einstein.</p>

<p>Throughout history, every great leader/ businessman was successful because of his/her simple yet deep philosophies. People usually complicate tiniest things, leading to chaos. Leaders should always work hard to keep things simple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>âSimple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But itâs worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.â â Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>

[A saint, who fought for justice and equality, well known for defining ethics, policies, also for coaching major fighters, like Karna, Bhishma, Drona, â¦]</p>

<p>No matter, how small or huge, a companyâs success is based on how good itâs core principals policies are. A leader should take huge care, defining these policies as These policies are the backbone of any organization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>â Law and order are the medicine of body politic and when body politic gets sick, medicine must be administeredâ â B.R. Ambedkar, architect of constitution of India</p>

[A Prince, famous for his journey to get back his kidnapped wife. Fought against fierce army of Lanka, with the help of a small army of monkeys]</p>

<p>Present day startup entrepreneurs/CEO must truly understand this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>âYou canât do everythingâ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An effective leader should know, whatâs a good idea is when they hear one and to give credit to the person with the idea. A great leader needs to be able to delegate work effectively. Best way to achieve it by giving members ownership of work, assigned to them.</p>

<p>A Leader needs to show humility and honesty to their team. Being honest removes the obstacles between him/herself and the team.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>âTrust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly, and they will show themselves great.â âRalph Waldo Emerson</p>

[A prince, symbol of love and happiness]</p>

<p>Any team/people, including their leader, are humans first, whose ultimate goal is to be happy. Seizing the moment and bringing fun and creativity in the workplace are core strategies of the good leader. Real people are attracted to real people, not to monotonic and machine-minded ones. A leader should know about his teamâs work and make sure that they were never overburdened.</p>

<p>Moreover, give people a little love, get it back multiplied by 100.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>âWork without love is slaveryâ â Mother Teresa</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a huge conflict on who next (Vishnu&rsquo;s 9th avatar) is. Different scriptures suggest different one, Balarama or Buddha. Whoever it is, they suggest the same â Self Realization.</p>

<p>A true leader spends an adequate amount of time, evaluating him/herself. They must know their strengths and weaknesses. After all, how can someone organize a team when they themselves are not organized.</p>

<p>Also, leaders should put their egoâs aside and collaborate with others to achieve a common goal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>âWe all need people who will give us feedback. Thatâs how we improveâ â Bill Gates</p>

<p>[Destroyer or Apocalypse, considered as end of world or beginning of new lifecycle ]</p>

<p>Every leader has to realize that everything comes to an end. Trying to stick to traditional methods, even after people getting bored, is insane(Gaddafi, for example). The world doesnât like monopoly. After a certain time, every leader/entrepreneur must reinvent himself or accept that itâs time to step aside and give way to new ones.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>âI came to this decision and when I came to it, I was very clear in my mind. it was time for the ânext generation of the young Indian cricketersâ to take over.â â Rahul Dravid on announcing his retirement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything comes to end. A good leader accepts it and lets others take their place.</p>

<p>All the above-mentioned qualities or avatars are based on my perspective. Not sure about facts though. I hope you enjoyed the article, feel free to provide feedback. Thank you.</p>

<p>Interaction with a Lyft driver, Ms. X, as soon as I got into the car and greeted her with big smile and a happy face.</p>

<p>X: Wow! you seem to be very happy.</p>

<p>Me: Yeah. It is a bright day&hellip;
&hellip;
(continued discussing about random topics for some time )
&hellip;
X: You know, we don&rsquo;t get to see a lot of happy faces in DC. People are always serious, sad or looking into phones.</p>

<p>Me: Sometimes, I feel the same too. Look at them (pointing to few pedestrians), All of them are serious.</p>

<p>Me: Maybe, I would have been like that too, if it wasn&rsquo;t for that guy who was all cheerful and happy while giving my documents before (Went to Indian Embassy to pickup some documents).<br />
I guess, happiness is contagious. I am pretty sure, your next customer will be happy seeing your face now.</p>

<p>X: They sure do. I guess it&rsquo;s like the ripple thing, people keep talking about.</p>

<p>Interaction with an amazing professor of Philosophy, Ms. X, while waiting for pizza.</p>

<p>Me: So, I was reading this book from Simon Sinek, recently and was wondering how, from Napoleon Hill to Simon Sinek, everyone talks about the importance of Defining Your Purpose. Would Love to know your thoughts on it?</p>

<p>X: Yes. Defining your why is the most important step for anything. Relationships, career, organizations, life, &hellip;<br />
For example, You can have the fastest car in the world. But if you don&rsquo;t know where you want to go, you will just be drifting around, going nowhere.<br />
On the other hand, if you know where exactly you want to go, you have a plenty of travel choices i.e. buses, trains and might not even need a car at all.</p>

<p>Me: Wow! That&rsquo;s one of the finest examples I heard of.</p>

<p>X: Thanks. Many people knew this, in theory, i.e. the importance of knowing why, but often people get lost into the charm of such fast cars that they forget where they wanted to go.</p>

<p>Me (Silent, Took few seconds to process that statement): That&rsquo;s deep.</p>

<p>Still thinking about it. How many destinations have we missed or forgotten, in the charm of cars? Postponed journeys waiting for that perfect vehicle or time.</p>

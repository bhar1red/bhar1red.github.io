X : I should probably look for another city. Who would setup a company in a cyclone prone area? It&rsquo;s dream of &lsquo;IT hub&rsquo; will be a dream.
Me: Where else would you find people, whose spirits aren&rsquo;t deterred even by such destruction?
where else would you find people that help everyone in the team, even if it&rsquo;s not their job?
where else would you find people working, building their city back, even without power and with food, water shortages ?
where else would you find people that don&rsquo;t keep complaining and move on irrespective of circumstances?   "/>

<p>Me: Where else would you find people, whose spirits aren&rsquo;t deterred even by such destruction?<br>
where else would you find people that help everyone in the team, even if it&rsquo;s not their job?<br>
where else would you find people working, building their city back, even without power and with food, water shortages ?<br>
where else would you find people that don&rsquo;t keep complaining and move on irrespective of circumstances?</p>
<p>Now, just relate these to a project in your company. Trust me, you can never find a better place than Vizag.</p>

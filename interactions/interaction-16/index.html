<p>I don&rsquo;t usually get offended or irritated, but interactions like these, make me feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>As you might already know, we are establishing a web-development firm and is currently looking for more projects. Met X, who is opening a new shop and called me to discuss his branding and development needs.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>After a lengthy discussion on how we can improve his shop&rsquo;s digital footprint.</p>

<p>X: So, how much would you charge?</p>

<p>Me: Well, I can&rsquo;t say right away, need to analyze more, but for similar services, we are charging $***** for another client. (Wouldn&rsquo;t reveal the price but it is in thousands)</p>

<p>X: Are you kidding? I can get it in Squarespace or Wix for less than a 100 bucks.</p>

<p>Me: well then, please go with it. (Stood up and started leaving.)</p>

<p>X: Wait! You still haven&rsquo;t answered me for your price difference.</p>

<p>Me: I would like to remind a couple of things here
- Web Development doesn&rsquo;t mean just including a theme. It includes customization, SEO, SMO, Deployment/Hosting, Security, testing, content-entry, &hellip;
- ‎Our discussion is not just development, but also branding and marketing which includes a lot more like the logo, lead generation strategies, content&hellip;</p>

<p>X: Well I can get them done for much cheaper prices on freelancer or fiverr. Looks like you are expecting way too profit margins.</p>

<p>Me: Imagine you have a medical problem. You can do your own research on the internet and use a house-therapy suggested by someone on Quora or go to a pharmacist, tell him your symptoms and let them give a generic medicine.
But you would instead go to a doctor who does a thorough diagnosis, sometimes the problem is not what you thought it was, might refer you to a specialist if needed, treat as necessary, support you until you get healthy.</p>

<p>This is the same. It is your decision if you want to do your own diagnosis or consult a doctor but please don&rsquo;t compare them.</p>

<p>X: Looks like you have got offended. All I am saying is you don&rsquo;t have to spend or invest much, why charge &hellip;. money then?</p>

<p>Me: We do. We invest time, expertise and skills.</p>

<p>These kinds of interactions we all face every day, across multiple fields. As freelancers, recruiters, artists, photographers, models, copy-writers, mentors, &hellip; Thing is we don&rsquo;t mind doing it for free for our friends or non-profit causes, but if you are adding value to your product/business, with our services, we do expect to get paid for the value we add.</p>

           <p>I was talking to a 5 yr old girl, X and asked her to tell a story, while she is sketching</p>
<p>X - Drew 3 figures on a paper, started speaking, pointing to them :</p>
<p>This is a princess, and this is her mean step mom. She used to trouble princess. This is prince. They both killed their mean step mom and lived happily.</p>
<p>Me : Oh that’s good. Can you tell another one.</p>
<p>X - Again drew 3 more figures : This is the princess, and this is an ugly monster.
Monster attacked princess. Then prince came and saved her, and killed the monster.</p>
<p>Me : Well, another one.</p>
<p>X - Drew 3 more figures : This is the princess, you see her big gown. This is the bad guy.
Prince came and fights the bad guy and saved the princess.</p>
<p>As cute as she said it, it is equally frightening. This is not how children should be influenced.</p>
<p><em>To all young girls - There will be no prince charming, coming to your rescue. You have to fight your own battles.</em></p>

      <description>I read this as a teen and never felt so inspired. I still keep reading to keep myself inspired.
 If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, donâ€™t deal in lies,</description>

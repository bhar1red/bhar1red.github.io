      <description>I read this as a teen and never felt so inspired. I still keep reading to keep myself inspired.
 If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,</description>

      <description>I was scrolling through my news feed, and shocked at what I found.
First, It was a story about a news paper vendor that helped Bill Gates when he doesn&#39;t have money. - Fake
Next, It was a story about an interaction between JRD Tata and Amitabh - Fake.
Then, another couple of posts describing interactions where either candidates outsmarted interviewers or employees outsmarted their bosses. - Fake  Followed by a question of &amp;ldquo;what do you think?</description>

      <description>It was a sunday evening and we were discussing random topics among our friends. One of the topics that came up, was on how to communicate effectively? or more precisely, how to discuss crucial topics, without either one being offended. This discussion, reminded me of an old yet, timeless speech by Napoleon Hill on 10 Rules for Profitable Self Discipline.
The 10 Rules for Profitable self discipline are
1. Keep cool when others get hot.</description>

      <description>There have been a lot of articles on leadership/ entrepreneurial skills these days. But you know, these qualities have been mentioned hundreds of years ago. In fact, the hidden goal of ‘Bhagavatam’ from Hindu mythology (Ten forms of Vishnu) might be to explain these qualities, in a filmy style, though. I would like to explain what each avatar is trying to portray and how they are relevant in today&#39;s world.</description>

      <description>Raavana, Overconfident and obsessed with his powers, once wanted to meet Shiva but Nandhi (Shiva&#39;s gatekeeper) denies his entry to Mt. Kailash.
Enraged by this, Raavana starts uprooting the mountain. To keep him in check, Shiva pushes the Mt. Khailas down, with his feet, trapping Raavana underneath it.
Without losing hope and being determined to live, Raavana spends next few years, trying to impress Shiva, by singing various hymns (Shiva Tandava Stotra, was result of the same), while being trapped under the mountain and using all his energy to prevent it from crushing him.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read this as a teen and never felt so inspired. I still keep reading to keep myself inspired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://res.cloudinary.com/dkjdeuwlv/image/upload/c_scale,w_500,f_auto/v1580319655/bargavkondapu.com/posts/if-rudyard-kipling.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;If by Rudyard Kipling&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can keep your head when all about you&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But make allowance for their doubting too;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;   &lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  &lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  &lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And treat those two impostors just the same;  &lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;    &lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can make one heap of all your winnings &lt;br&gt;&#xA;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And lose, and start again at your beginnings&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And never breathe a word about your loss;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To serve your turn long after they are gone,  &lt;br&gt;&#xA;And so hold on when there is nothing in you&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ &lt;br&gt;&#xA;   &lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If all men count with you, but none too much;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If you can fill the unforgiving minute&lt;br&gt;&#xA;With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,  &lt;br&gt;&#xA;And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was scrolling through my news feed, and shocked at what I found.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, It was a story about a news paper vendor that helped Bill Gates when he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have money.  - Fake&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, It was a story about an interaction between JRD Tata and Amitabh - Fake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, another couple of posts describing interactions where either candidates outsmarted interviewers or employees outsmarted their bosses. - Fake &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;Followed by a question of &amp;ldquo;what do you think?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Follow for more such stories&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>10 Rules for Profitable Self Discipline</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a sunday evening and we were discussing random topics among our friends. One of the topics that came up, was on how to communicate effectively? or more precisely, how to discuss crucial topics, without either one being offended. This discussion, reminded me of an old yet, timeless speech by Napoleon Hill on 10 Rules for Profitable Self Discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 10 Rules for Profitable self discipline are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;1. Keep cool when others get hot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;2. Remember that there are 3 sides of an argument. Your side, other side and the right side, which is usually between the first two.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;3. Never give directions when angry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;4. Treat all people as good as you would, yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;5. Look for the seed of equivalent benefit in every situation&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;6. Learn the almost forgotten art of asking questions and then listening to their answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;7. Never say or do anything that may influence other person, without asking yourself this question : Will it benefit them or hurt them ? If it hurts, don&amp;rsquo;t say or do it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;8. Learn the difference between a friendly analysis and unfriendly criticism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;9. A good leaders in any calling, take orders as cheerfully as he/she gives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;10. Tolerance in human relations is just as important as tolerance in operation of mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Leadership Ft Dashavatar</title>
      <link>https://bargavkondapu.com/posts/leadership-ft-dashavatar/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There have been a lot of articles on leadership/ entrepreneurial skills these days. But you know, these qualities have been mentioned hundreds of years ago. In fact, the hidden goal of ‘Bhagavatam’ from Hindu mythology (Ten forms of Vishnu) might be to explain these qualities, in a filmy style, though. I would like to explain what each avatar is trying to portray and how they are relevant in today&amp;rsquo;s world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Kailash&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Raavana, Overconfident and obsessed with his powers, once wanted to meet Shiva but Nandhi (Shiva&amp;rsquo;s gatekeeper) denies his entry to Mt. Kailash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enraged by this, Raavana starts uprooting the mountain. To keep him in check, Shiva pushes the Mt. Khailas down, with his feet, trapping Raavana underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without losing hope and being determined to live, Raavana spends next few years, trying to impress Shiva, by singing various hymns (Shiva Tandava Stotra, was result of the same), while being trapped under the mountain and using all his energy to prevent it from crushing him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
